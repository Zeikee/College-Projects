                <h4>DOH, WHO launch Philippine Council for Mental Health Strategic Framework 2024-2028</h4>
                <p>
                    The Department of Health and the World Health Organization jointly launched the 2024–2028 Philippine
                    Council for Mental Health Strategic Framework to address the significant burden of mental illness
                    and enhance mental health and well-being in the nation. This framework serves as a guide for developing
                    and implementing mental health policies, programs, and services. The five-year strategic plan, which
                    aims
                    to lower premature mortality, effectively prevent and treat substance abuse, and lessen the
                    vulnerability
                    of individuals and communities to mental, neurological, and substance use disorders, was developed in
                    collaboration with numerous government agencies and important stakeholders. Through the implementation
                    of mental health policies, the PCMH, which the WHO Special Initiative backs for Mental Health, works to
                    advance Filipinos' fundamental right to mental health.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With 362 access sites nationwide dispensing 30 mental health medicines and serving 124,246 service users
                    in 2022, the Philippines has increased the availability of quality medicines and mental health services
                    since the Mental Health Act of 2018 was passed. Through the ongoing execution of the Mental Health Gap
                    Action Program in LGUs, the DOH also equipped health and non-health professionals with mental health
                    competencies to advance the protection of service users at the primary care level. Additionally, the
                    National Center for Mental Health developed its round-the-clock crisis hotlines. The government
                    implemented
                    strategies across various agencies and educational institutions to transform communities responsive to
                    mental health. This led to the establishment of mental health workplace policies in 78,449 private
                    establishments, which ensure the safety and well-being of their employees; the provision of "behavioral
                    nudges" by 54 hospitals to help health workers manage stress; and the use of 273 last-mile elementary
                    schools as implementation sites for a comprehensive range of mental health measures under the Healthy
                    Learning Institutions Framework.

                <h4>Mental health crisis a rising epidemic in PH’ – experts</h4>
                <p>
                    The Philippine Mental Health Association Inc. on Monday raised the alarm over the “rising epidemic of
                    mental health crisis” in the country. The professionals and advocates said the situation needs
                    widespread awareness, support, and action. “We have noticed a sharp increase in mental health concerns
                    during and after the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns,” PMHA president Dr. Cornelio Banaag Jr. said during
                    a World Mental Health Day event in Cagayan. “Mental health-related issues affect Filipinos of all ages
                    and backgrounds. It is a silent epidemic that we need to confront head-on,” he added. In the
                    Philippines,
                    mental illness is becoming a common disability, and at least 3.6 million Filipinos suffer from mental,
                    neurological, and substance use disorders, according to the Department of Health. The PMHA said access
                    to mental health services in the country remains limited and unequal due to stigma and scarce resources.
                    There is also less than one mental health worker for every 100,000 Filipinos, they added. PMHA urged a
                    whole-of-society approach to address mental health concerns. “Mental health is a universal human right,”
                    Banaag said. PMHA called for the stronger implementation of the Philippine Mental Health Act or Republic
                    Act No. 11036, more funding to expand mental health services, and a constant public awareness campaign.

                    <h3>Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
                        approximately 3.3 million Filipinos suffer from depressive
                        disorders. Anxiety disorders are also prevalent,
                        affecting around 3.1 million people.

                    <h3>Limited Access to Mental Health Services</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Philippines has a limited number of mental health
                        professionals. As of recent estimates, there are only
                        about 2 to 3 mental health workers per 100,000 people,
                        including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers.

                    <h3>Stigma and Cultural Barriers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mental health issues are often stigmatized in the Philippines,
                        leading to reluctance to seek help. Cultural beliefs
                        and lack of awareness contribute to this stigma, making it
                        challenging for individuals to access the care they need.

                    <h3>Prevalence of Mental Health Disorder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Around 3.6 million Filipinos are currently dealing with mental
                        health issues, including conditions such as depression,
                        anxiety, and bipolar disorder. This estimate highlights the
                        significant mental health burden in the country, especially
                        in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <h3>Connection Between Mental Health and Economic Loss</h3>
                    <p>
                        The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that depression
                        and anxiety cost the global economy approximately $1 trillion
                        each year in lost productivity, highlighting the significant
                        economic impact of mental health disorders, which aligns
                        with SDG 3's focus on promoting mental health and well-being.
