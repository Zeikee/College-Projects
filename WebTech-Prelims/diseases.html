                <p class="cs-text">
                    The Philippines has made significant investments and advances in health in recent years. 
                    Rapid economic growth and strong country capacity have contributed to Filipinos living longer and healthier. 
                    However, not all the benefits of this growth have reached the most vulnerable groups, and the health system remains fragmented.  
                    Health insurance now covers 92% of the population. Maternal and child health services have improved, with more children living beyond infancy, 
                    a higher number of women delivering at health facilities and more births being attended by professional service providers than ever before. 
                    Access to and provision of preventive, diagnostic and treatment services for communicable diseases have improved, 
                    while there are several initiatives to reduce illness and death due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). 
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Despite substantial progress in improving the lives and health of people in the Philippines, 
                    achievements have not been uniform and challenges remain. Deep inequities persist between regions, 
                    rich and poor, and different population groups. Many Filipinos continue to die or suffer from illnesses that have well-proven, 
                    cost-effective interventions, such as tuberculosis, HIV, and dengue, or diseases affecting mothers and children. 
                    Many people lack sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions about their own health. Rapid economic development, 
                    urbanization, escalating climate change, and widening exposure to diseases and pathogens in an increasingly 
                    global world increase the risks associated with disasters, environmental threats, and emerging and re-emerging infections.

                <p class="cs-text">
                    Global challenges such as rising urbanization, population density, 
                    global mobility, and climate change are all increasing the risk of large-scale disease outbreaks, 
                    especially in countries and regions that already experience a high incidence of infectious diseases. 
                    Like many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines frequently copes with disease outbreaks 
                    and public health emergencies, and its high vulnerability to natural disasters exacerbates these risks. 
                    Most recently, the Philippines was one of the countries in the region hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                    with economic development disrupted by some of the longest lockdowns in the world.

                <h3>Smallpox Victory</h3>
                <p>
                    Smallpox is the only human disease that has been completely eradicated thanks to a global
                    vaccination campaign. The last natural outbreak occurred in Somalia in 1977, and the disease was
                    officially declared eradicated in 1980.

                <h3>Polio Progress</h3>
                <p>
                    Polio cases have dropped by over 99% since 1988 due to global vaccination efforts. Only a few
                    countries still have endemic polio, showing the tremendous progress in the fight against this
                    disease.

                <h3>HIV Treatment Breakthrough</h3>
                <p>
                    The development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV/AIDS from a death sentence to
                    a manageable chronic condition. People with HIV who adhere to ART can live long, healthy lives
                    and reduce the risk of transmission to others.

                <h3>Malaria and Mosquitoes</h3>
                <p>
                    Malaria, caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites, has been significantly reduced
                    in many regions due to insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor spraying. Research is ongoing to
                    develop a malaria vaccine to further combat the disease.

                <p>
                    Despite challenges, the global TB death rate has dropped by 40% since 1990.
                    New treatments and diagnostic tools continue to improve, helping to tackle
                    this persistent disease more effectively.
